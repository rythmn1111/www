    <p>
      AURA is designed with privacy in mind. We do not collect, store, or
      share any of your personal data. Here's what that means:

    <h3 class="mt-4 text-xl !font-bold" id="-1-1-no-telemetry-">
      <strong class="font-bold">1.1. No Telemetry</strong>
    </h3>
    <p>We do not collect any telemetry data or crash reports.</p>
    <p>
      AURA has stripped out telemetry built into Mozilla Firefox. We have
      removed all telemetry data collection and crash reports.

    <h3 class="mt-4 text-xl !font-bold" id="-1-2-no-personal-data-collection-">
      <strong class="font-bold">1.2. No Personal Data Collection</strong>
    </h3>
    <p>
      AURA does not collect any personal information such as your IP
      address, browsing history, search queries, or form data.
    </p>
    <h3 class="mt-4 text-xl !font-bold" id="-1-4-no-third-party-tracking-">
      <strong class="font-bold">1.3. No Third-Party Tracking</strong>
    </h3>
    <p>
      We do not allow third-party trackers or analytics tools to operate within
      AURA. Your browsing activity remains entirely private and is not
      shared with any third party. Mozilla is not considered a third party as it
      is the base of AURA.
    </p>

      <strong class="font-bold">1.4. External connections made at startup</strong>
    </h3>
    <p>
      AURA may make external connections at startup to check for updates
      and ensure the browser is up to date on plugins, addons, check for connectivity
      and Geolocation/push notifications services in order to comply with
      web standards. We, at AURA, do not collect any data from these connections, but
      they may be logged by third-party services or websites you visit. These
      connections are necessary for the proper functioning of the browser and
      are not used for tracking or profiling purposes. They can be disabled
      through the browser flags (about:config).

      AURA offers a &quot;Sync&quot; feature, which is implemented using
